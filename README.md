# quickcast.io mac app

Please visit the [http://quickcast.io](QuickCast) site for links to the source for the QuickCast Viewer + API

You will need http://cocoapods.org to build with the required external libraries.

The Amazon AWS Toolkit had to be embedded as it's a Frankenstein version of the library to cover the functionality required by QuickCast.

Encoding is done by FFMPEG to create a smaller MP4 for upload and then AWS Elastic Transcoding creates the mp4 and webm for use online. Further encoding may be encoded in the app as follows:[https://github.com/adexin-team/refinerycms-videojs/wiki/Encoding-files-to-.webm-(VP8)-and-.mp4-(h.264)-using-ffmpeg](Encoding files to webm)

As we are still debugging I've put in excessive error outputs that will get cleaned up as problems are tackled on different platforms.

**Please log all problems to Github Issues rather than Twitter!  Thanks for your feedback!**
